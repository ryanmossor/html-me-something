                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my website! This page contains a brief overview about my history with speedrunning, a
                    hobby I’ve been involved with since 2013.</p>
                <p>Before we begin, though, what even is speedrunning?
                    <span><strong><em>Speedrunning</em></strong></span> is a style
                    of playing video games wherein the purpose is to complete the game as quickly as possible.
                </p>
                <p>Sometimes, people are confused when I tell them this is one of my hobbies. I’ve been asked, “Don't
                    you get bored of playing the same game over and over?” While I understand this perspective,
                    speedrunning has added limitless depth and replay
                    value to my favorite games. Just as it’s enjoyable to watch yourself improve at basketball, chess,
                    or programming, it’s also fun to keep getting faster and more skilled at a video game you love to
                    play.</p>

                <h2>Ocarina of Time and the "Uber Challenge"</h2>
                <p>In 2008, before I even knew what speedrunning was, I had just finished replaying through <em>The
                        Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em> with my friend Jacob. While searching the Internet for
                    trivia and secrets about the game, Jacob found something called
                    the "<a href=https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/n64/197771-the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/faqs/44025
                        target="_blank">Ocarina
                        of Time Uber Challenge</a>" and suggested we try it out.</p>
                <div>
                    <img class="oot" src="/images/oot.png" alt="Ocarina of Time box art">
                </div>
                <p>The Uber Challenge was a self-imposed challenge that required players to complete the game with no
                    health upgrades, no shield, a broken sword, no deaths, and several other much more
                    difficult restrictions. To do this, you needed to exploit game mechanics
                    and complete many things out of their intended sequence. The challenge took me nearly two months,
                    and some of the tricks and exploits took me many hours of attempts to
                    pull off successfully.</p>
                <p>Though the Uber Challenge was frustrating at times, I was also fascinated by what was possible in
                    Ocarina of Time with glitches and exploits. I played through the game 10-15 more times during
                    2008, learning new tricks upon each subsequent playthrough. I also discovered speedruns while
                    learning new techniques,
                    since speedrunners often use glitches and exploits to play through the game faster.</p>

                <h2>AGDQ 2013 and Renewed Interest</h2>
                <p>After 2008, Jacob and I moved on to other interests, and I didn't really follow speedrunning for a
                    few years. However, in March 2013 I came across a YouTube video of an Ocarina of Time
                    speedrun performed by a runner named Cosmo. This run was done at <a
                        href="https://gamesdonequick.com/">Awesome Games Done Quick</a> 2013, a
                    yearly speedrunning marathon event which showcases a full week’s worth of speedruns to raise money
                    for charity.</p>
                <p>In 2008, speedruns of Ocarina of Time
                    were typically <em>segmented</em> (i.e., they were done in short chunks and strung together in a
                    YouTube playlist, which allowed runners to keep retrying for optimal segments), and a full run
                    took several hours from start to finish.</p>
                <p>By contrast, Cosmo’s run was done in one sitting, was performed in front of a live audience,
                    contained excellent commentary about the run and the game’s speedrun history, and was completed in
                    just 22 minutes.</p>

                </div>
                <p>I was amazed by Cosmo’s run and how far Ocarina of
                    Time speedruns had come in the past five years, and I soon found myself frequently watching videos
                    and livestreams of speedruns of Ocarina of Time and other games.</p>

                <h2>Bingo and Racing</h2>
                <p>After watching speedruns for a few months, I started playing around in Ocarina of Time for the first
                    time in years. I revisited some of the old tricks I knew from 2008, but also tried out some of the
                    newer techniques I’d seen in more recent runs. I never intended to start speedrunning myself, but it
                    wasn’t long before I joined my first race against other Ocarina of Time community members.</p>
                <p>In August 2013, I joined my first Ocarina of Time bingo race and quickly became hooked. In a bingo
                    race, all players are given the same randomly-generated board of in-game objectives, and the goal is
                    to get a “bingo” by completing all
                    five objectives in a given row, column, or diagonal on the board.</p>
                <figure>
                    <a href="https://ootbingo.github.io/bingo/v10.1/bingo.html?mode=normal&seed=162460"
                        target="_blank"><img id="bingo" src="/images/bingo.png" alt="Sample bingo board"></a>
                    <figcaption><em>Sample bingo board</em></figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>I loved the unique nature of bingo races. No two bingo boards are the same, and becoming
                    proficient
                    enough at the game to feel comfortable doing any given row requires a ton of game knowledge,
                    execution skill, and ability to plan things out on-the-fly.</p>
                <p>I quit my first few races since I didn’t know enough to finish in a reasonable
                    amount of time, and my first few finishes took nearly three hours (a good bingo time is
                    around 1:15:00). I kept at it, though, and slowly became better as I practiced more and learned
                    faster techniques. It was incredibly rewarding to see myself steadily improve and surpass the
                    sub-two-hour,
                    sub-1:30:00, and sub-1:20:00 milestones.</p>

                <h2>Ocarina of Time Championship Series</h2>
                <p>Aside from bingo races, some of my favorite Ocarina of Time experiences are from the <a
                        href="https://www.ootchampionship.com/" target="_blank">Ocarina of Time
                        Championship Series (OCS)</a>. OCS is a series of weekly challenge races that require players to
                    complete a specific objective, often while imposing a variety of restrictions. Like bingo, challenge
                    races also test players' overall game knowledge, execution ability, and planning capabilities.</p>
                <figure>

                </figure>
                <p>Players are awarded points based on how well they perform in each race, and the top 16 overall
                    players at the end of the season compete in the OCS Playoffs to determine the winner. After missing
                    the Season 2 playoffs by a single placement, I'll get to compete in the playoffs for this season
                    since I finished in the top 10 out of 70+ total entrants throughout the season. The standard races
                    for Season 3 just finished on February 28, and playoff races start on March 14!</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>In summary, I’m grateful for all that speedrunning has provided me over the past seven years. Beyond
                    just being a fun pastime, it’s introduced me to some of my closest friends, with whom I’ve spent
                    hundreds of hours racing and bantering. I’ve even had the opportunity to travel to AGDQ events a few
                    times myself, where I’ve met these friends in person. Each time I’ve gone to an AGDQ, it’s been one
                    of the greatest experiences of my life.</p>
                <p>These days, I don’t speedrun nearly as much as I used to. Most of my friends I made through racing
                    have gotten busy with life and have moved on, and I also haven’t been able to spend as much time
                    with it due to other obligations. However, I still do bingo races with a good friend every
                    now and then, and I’ve fortunately been able to play through the entirety of the OCS season this
                    year.</p>
