                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my web page! This page contains a brief overview about my history with speedrunning, a
                    hobby I’ve been involved with since 2013. I’ll first cover how I became interested in speedrunning
                    before delving into some of the specific aspects of speedrunning I enjoy the most.</p>
                <p>Before we begin though, what even is speedrunning?
                    <span><strong><em>Speedrunning</em></strong></span> is a style
                    of playing a video game wherein the purpose is to complete a set of objectives as quickly as
                    possible (e.g., beat the game as quickly as possible or collect all in-game items as quickly as
                    possible). Some speedrunners are extremely dedicated to their pursuit to become the fastest at their
                    respective game; it’s not uncommon for top contenders in a game to have several thousand attempts
                    under their belts.
                </p>
                <p>Sometimes, people are confused when I tell them this is one of my hobbies. I’ve been asked, “Why
                    would you ever want to play the same game over and over again? Don’t you get bored?” I certainly
                    understand this perspective, but in my experience, speedrunning has added limitless depth and replay
                    value to my favorite games. Just as it’s enjoyable to watch yourself improve at basketball, chess,
                    or programming, it’s also fun to keep getting faster and more skilled at a video game you love to
                    play.</p>

                <h2>Über Challenge</h2>
                <p>In 2008, before I even knew what speedrunning was, I had just finished replaying through <em>The
                        Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em> with my friend Jacob. After finishing the game, Jacob was
                    looking on the GameFAQs website for additional information and secrets. He found a document for
                    something called the "<a
                        href=https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/n64/197771-the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/faqs/44025
                        target="_blank">Ocarina
                        of Time Uber Challenge</a>" and suggested we try it out.</p>
                <p>The Uber Challenge was a self-imposed challenge that required players to complete the game with no
                    health upgrades, no shield, a broken sword, and no deaths, among a number of other much more
                    difficult restrictions. To meet the challenge’s requirements, you needed to exploit game mechanics
                    and complete many things out of their intended sequence. It took me nearly two months to complete
                    the challenge, and some of the required tricks and exploits took me several hours of attempts to
                    pull off successfully.</p>
                <p>Though the Uber Challenge was frustrating at times, I was also interested by what was possible in
                    Ocarina of Time with glitches and exploits. I played through the game probably 10 more times during
                    2008, each time learning new techniques and doing different parts of the game out of order. I also
                    discovered speedruns while searching for new techniques, since speedrunners often use glitches and
                    exploits to play through the game faster. I was fascinated watching people quickly execute difficult
                    techniques and finish the game faster than I thought possible.

                <h2>AGDQ 2013 and Renewed Interest</h2>
                <p>After 2008, Jacob and I moved on to other interests, and I didn’t keep up with speedrunning much
                    between then and 2013. However, in March 2013 I came across a YouTube video of an Ocarina of Time
                    speedrun performed by a runner named Cosmo. This run was done at Awesome Games Done Quick 2013, a
                    yearly speedrunning marathon event which showcases a full week’s worth of speedruns to raise money
                    for charity.</p>
                <p>I remember being awestruck by several aspects of Cosmo’s run. In 2008, speedruns of Ocarina of Time
                    were typically <em>segmented</em> (i.e., they were done in short chunks and strung together in a
                    YouTube playlist, which allowed runners to keep retrying for optimal segments), and a full run
                    took several hours from start to finish. By contrast, Cosmo’s run was single-segment, contained
                    excellent commentary about the run and the game’s speedrun history, was performed in front of a live
                    audience, and was completed in just 22 minutes.</p>

                </div>
                <p>I was blown away by Cosmo’s run and how far Ocarina of
                    Time speedruns had come in the past 5 years, and I soon found myself spending most of my free
                    time watching videos and livestreams of speedruns of Ocarina of Time and other games.</p>

                <h2>Bingo and Racing</h2>
                <p>After watching speedruns regularly for a few months, I gradually started playing around with
                    techniques in Ocarina of Time for the first time in years. I revisited some of the old tricks I knew
                    from 2008, but also tried replicating some of the newer techniques I’d seen in more recent runs. At
                    the time, I never intended to start speedrunning myself, but it wasn’t long before I joined my first
                    race against other Ocarina of Time community members.</p>
                <p>In August 2013, I joined my first Ocarina of Time bingo race and quickly became hooked. In a bingo
                    race, all players are given the same randomly-generated board of in-game objectives (e.g., collect a
                    certain item, beat a specific dungeon, etc.), and the goal is to get a “bingo” by completing all
                    five objectives in a given row, column, or diagonal on the board.</p>
                <!-- <div><iframe
                        src="https://ootbingo.github.io/bingo/board-popout.html?seed=162460&mode=normal&version=v10.1"
                        title="Sample bingo board" width=600px height=530px frameBorder=0></iframe> -->

                <figcaption><em>Sample bingo board</em></figcaption>
                <!-- </div> -->

                <p>I loved the unique nature of bingo races. No two bingo boards are the same, and becoming
                    proficient
                    enough at the game to feel comfortable doing any given row requires a ton of game knowledge,
                    execution skill, and ability to plan things out on-the-fly.</p>
                <p>I had to quit my first few bingo races since I didn’t know enough to finish in a reasonable
                    amount of time, and my first few finishes took roughly three hours (a good bingo time is around
                    1:15:00). I kept at it, though, and slowly became better as I practiced more and learned faster
                    techniques. I still remember how rewarding it was to finish my first bingo races in under two
                    hours, under 1:30:00, and under 1:20:00.</p>

                <h2>Ocarina of Time Championship Series</h2>
                <p>Aside from bingo races, some of my favorite Ocarina of Time experiences are from the Ocarina of Time
                    Championship Series (OCS). OCS is a series of weekly challenge races that require players to
                    complete a specific objective, often while imposing a variety of restrictions. Like bingo, challenge
                    races also test players' overall game knowledge, execution ability, and planning capabilities.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Players are awarded points based on how well they perform in each race, and the top 16 overall
                    players at the end of the season compete in the OCS Playoffs to determine the winner. Unfortunately,
                    I missed all of Season 1 because of school, and I finished in 17th place overall in Season 2. I’ll
                    get to try my hand at the playoffs this season, though, since I finished in the top 16 out of 70+
                    total entrants throughout the season. The standard races for Season 3 just finished on February 28,
                    and playoff races start on March 14.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>In summary, I’m grateful for all that speedrunning has provided me over the past seven years. Beyond
                    just being a fun pastime, it’s introduced me to some of my closest friends, with whom I’ve spent
                    hundreds of hours racing and bantering. I’ve even had the opportunity to travel to AGDQ events a few
                    times myself, where I’ve met these friends in person. Each time I’ve gone to an AGDQ, it’s been one
                    of the greatest experiences of my life.</p>
                <p>These days, I don’t speedrun nearly as much as I used to. Most of my friends I made through racing
                    have gotten busy with life and have moved on, and I also haven’t been able to spend as much time
                    with it due to other obligations. However, I have a good friend I still do bingo races with every
                    now and then, and I’ve fortunately been able to play through the entirety of the OCS season this
                    year.</p>
